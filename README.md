🌿 Greenden - Plant Store Web Page
I have developed a responsive and modern web page for Greenden, an online plant store, using Tailwind CSS. This project was created to practice and enhance my frontend development skills while building a clean and attractive website for plant lovers.

The Greenden website is designed with a focus on simplicity, user experience, and mobile responsiveness. I utilized Tailwind CSS, a utility-first CSS framework, to style the entire web page efficiently without writing lengthy custom CSS code. This approach allowed me to maintain a consistent design and quickly apply styles using Tailwind’s predefined classes.

The homepage of the website features an eye-catching hero section that highlights the brand with engaging text and promotional messages like “Free & Fast Shipping” and “24/7 Customer Support”. Visitors can explore different sections including featured products, plant categories, and customer reviews. Product cards are styled with smooth hover effects, shadows, and rounded corners, giving the site a modern and clean look.

This project is fully responsive, ensuring a seamless experience across all devices such as mobiles, tablets, and desktops. The navigation bar, content sections, and footer adapt smoothly to different screen sizes.
